# Tasks: Core Data Layer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-data-layer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested - implementation tasks only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Shared code**: `src/shared/db/` (schemas, queries, types - reusable for React Native)
- **Main process**: `src/main/` (database, vault, ipc, lib)
- **Preload**: `src/preload/`
- **Renderer**: `src/renderer/src/` (services, hooks)

---

- [x] T002 Install dev dependencies: drizzle-kit, @electron/rebuild, @types/better-sqlite3, vitest
- [x] T003 [P] Add npm scripts to package.json (postinstall, rebuild, db:generate, db:push, db:studio)

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Track File Renames Without Breaking Links (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Use UUID-based identity tracking so renames don't break internal links

**Independent Test**: Create NoteA linking to NoteB using [[NoteB]]. Rename NoteB.md in Finder to NewName.md. Verify the link in NoteA still works.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Fast Search Across All Notes (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Provide full-text search returning results in under 50ms for 10,000 notes

**Independent Test**: With 1,000+ notes in vault, search for a term and measure response time. Results should appear in under 50ms.

- [ ] T067 [US4] Implement search result highlighting with snippet extraction in src/shared/db/queries/search.ts

**Checkpoint**: US4 complete - full-text search works across all notes with <50ms response time

---

## Phase 7: User Story 7 + User Story 8 - Progress Indication & Auto Recovery (Priority: P2)

**Goal (US7)**: Show indexing progress when opening vault with many files
**Goal (US8)**: Automatically rebuild index if corrupted, without data loss

**Independent Test (US7)**: Open a vault with 1,000 files for the first time. Verify progress indicator shows indexing status.
**Independent Test (US8)**: Manually corrupt index.db, reopen app. Verify automatic rebuild occurs and all notes are accessible.

- [ ] T072 [US8] Implement automatic index rebuild from source files in src/main/vault/indexer.ts
- [ ] T073 [US8] Add notification for auto-recovery completion in src/main/ipc/vault-handlers.ts

**Checkpoint**: US7+US8 complete - indexing progress is visible, and index corruption triggers automatic recovery

---

## Phase 8: User Story 9 + User Story 10 - Multiple Vaults & Exclusions (Priority: P3)

**Goal (US9)**: Support switching between multiple vault folders
**Goal (US10)**: Allow excluding folders (like .git, node_modules) from indexing

**Independent Test (US9)**: Create two vaults, switch between them. Verify each vault shows only its own notes.
**Independent Test (US10)**: Add a .git folder to vault. Verify files inside are not indexed or shown in search.

### Implementation for User Story 9 + 10

**Checkpoint**: US9+US10 complete - multiple vaults can be managed, and folders can be excluded from indexing

---

## Phase 9: Tasks Database Integration

**Goal**: Connect existing tasks UI to real SQLite database via Drizzle ORM

**Purpose**: Enable persistence of tasks, projects, and statuses that currently exist only in React Context

**Checkpoint**: Tasks UI is connected to real database, data persists between sessions

---

## Phase 10: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final improvements and cleanup

- [ ] T092 Run quickstart.md validation steps to verify setup
- [ ] T093 Update CLAUDE.md with new database commands and architecture notes

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
  - Within P1: US1 → US2/US3 (parallel) → US4
- **Tasks Integration (Phase 9)**: Can proceed after Foundational (independent of notes stories)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundational (Phase 2)
├── US1 (Store Notes) ──────────┬── US2 (External Changes)
│                               └── US3 (Rename Tracking)
│                                          │
└── US4 (Fast Search) ◄────────────────────┘
         │
         ├── US7+US8 (Progress/Recovery)
         │
         └── US9+US10 (Multi-Vault/Exclusions)
```

- **US1**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2**: Depends on US1 (file operations module)
- **US3**: Depends on US1 (frontmatter with UUID)
- **US4**: Depends on US1 (note cache for FTS), can start after US1
- **US7+US8**: Can start after US4 (indexer infrastructure)
- **US9+US10**: Can start after Foundational, mostly independent

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different config files)

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T009-T015 (7 schema files) can ALL run in parallel
- T022-T024 (3 utility files) can ALL run in parallel

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- After T037-T038 complete, remaining tasks are sequential

**Within Phase 4-6 (US2-US4)**:
- These phases are mostly sequential within themselves

**Across Stories (with team)**:
- Tasks Integration (Phase 9) is independent of notes user stories
- Can work on Phase 9 in parallel with Phase 3-8 if needed

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Schemas

```bash
# Launch all 7 schema files in parallel:
Task: "[P] Create projects schema in src/shared/db/schema/projects.ts"
Task: "[P] Create statuses schema in src/shared/db/schema/statuses.ts"
Task: "[P] Create tasks schema in src/shared/db/schema/tasks.ts"
Task: "[P] Create task-relations schema in src/shared/db/schema/task-relations.ts"
Task: "[P] Create inbox schema in src/shared/db/schema/inbox.ts"
Task: "[P] Create settings schema in src/shared/db/schema/settings.ts"
Task: "[P] Create notes-cache schema in src/shared/db/schema/notes-cache.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Setup + Foundational + US1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (dependencies, config)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (schemas, database, vault selection)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (note CRUD as markdown)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Create a note, check it's readable in external editor
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Vault opens, database ready
2. Add US1 → Notes work as portable markdown (MVP!)
3. Add US2 → External changes detected
4. Add US3 → Renames tracked by UUID
5. Add US4 → Fast search works
6. Add US7+US8 → Progress indicators, auto-recovery
7. Add US9+US10 → Multiple vaults, exclusions
8. Add Tasks Integration → Tasks persist to database
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Recommended MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Setup + Foundational + US1

This delivers:
- Users can select a vault folder
- Users can create, edit, delete notes
- Notes are plain markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Notes are readable/editable in any text editor
- Vault location is remembered between sessions

**Enhanced MVP**: Add US2 + US4 (external changes + search)

This adds:
- Real-time detection of external edits
- Fast full-text search across notes

| US7+US8 (Progress/Recovery) | 6 | 0 |
| US9+US10 (Multi-Vault) | 6 | 0 |
| Tasks Integration | 8 | 2 |
| Polish | 6 | 0 |
| **Total** | **93** | **15** |

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All schemas use Drizzle ORM patterns from research.md
- File operations use atomic write pattern from research.md
- File watching uses chokidar v4 patterns from research.md
