# Feature Specification: Encrypted Sync Engine

**Feature Branch**: `006-encrypted-sync`
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Build the sync engine that synchronizes encrypted data between devices with end-to-end encryption, offline support, and conflict resolution.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Cross-Device Data Synchronization (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want my data synced across desktop and mobile devices so I see the same content everywhere without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental value proposition of the sync feature. Without reliable cross-device sync, all other features are meaningless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making changes on Device A, then verifying they appear on Device B within the specified timeframe.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have two linked devices (desktop and mobile), **When** I create a note on my desktop, **Then** the note appears on my mobile within 5 seconds
2. **Given** I have edited a task on my mobile, **When** I open the desktop app, **Then** I see the updated task content
3. **Given** I delete a journal entry on one device, **When** I check other devices, **Then** the entry is removed everywhere

---

### User Story 2 - End-to-End Encryption (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want my data encrypted before it leaves my device so that even the server operator cannot read my personal information.

**Why this priority**: Privacy and security are core requirements for a personal knowledge management tool. Users must trust that their private thoughts and tasks are protected.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by inspecting server-stored data and confirming it is unreadable encrypted blobs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I save a note with sensitive content, **When** the data is transmitted to the server, **Then** the content is encrypted and unreadable without my encryption keys
2. **Given** the server database is accessed directly, **When** examining stored data, **Then** only encrypted blobs are visible with no plaintext content
3. **Given** I set up a new account, **When** completing the setup, **Then** I receive a recovery phrase that I must confirm before proceeding

---

### User Story 3 - Offline Support with Automatic Sync (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want sync to work when I come back online after being offline so I never lose my work regardless of network conditions.

**Why this priority**: Users work in various network conditions. The system must reliably capture all changes made offline and sync them when connectivity is restored.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making changes while disconnected, then reconnecting and verifying all changes sync properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am offline, **When** I create or edit content, **Then** changes are queued locally and persisted across app restarts
2. **Given** I have offline changes queued, **When** network connectivity is restored, **Then** all queued changes sync automatically
3. **Given** I have been offline for an extended period, **When** I come online, **Then** all accumulated changes sync in order without data loss

---

### User Story 4 - Sync Status Visibility (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see sync status clearly (syncing, synced, error, offline) so I always know the state of my data.

**Why this priority**: Users need confidence that their data is safe. Clear status indication reduces anxiety and helps troubleshoot issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering various sync states and verifying the UI reflects them accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sync is in progress, **When** I look at the sync indicator, **Then** I see "Syncing..." with items remaining count
2. **Given** sync has completed successfully, **When** I look at the sync indicator, **Then** I see "Synced" with last sync timestamp
3. **Given** a sync error occurs, **When** I look at the sync indicator, **Then** I see an error message with retry option
4. **Given** I am offline with queued changes, **When** I look at the sync indicator, **Then** I see "Offline" with queue count

---

### User Story 5 - Secure Device Linking (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to link new devices securely so I can access my data on multiple devices without compromising security.

**Why this priority**: Multi-device access is essential for the sync feature to be useful. The linking process must be both secure and user-friendly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by linking a new device and verifying it gains access to all synced content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an existing device set up, **When** I want to link a new device via QR code, **Then** the existing device shows a QR code that the new device can scan to complete linking
2. **Given** I lost access to all devices, **When** I enter my 24-word recovery phrase on a new device, **Then** I regain access to all my synced data
3. **Given** I enter an incorrect recovery phrase, **When** attempting to restore, **Then** I see a clear error message indicating the phrase is invalid
4. **Given** I have linked a new device, **When** I check device management, **Then** the new device appears in my list of linked devices

---

### User Story 6 - Automatic Conflict Resolution (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want conflicts handled automatically with a backup copy preserved so I don't lose work when editing on multiple devices.

**Why this priority**: Conflicts are inevitable with multi-device editing. Automatic resolution with backups prevents data loss while minimizing user friction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing the same item on two offline devices, bringing them online, and verifying conflict handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I edited the same note on two devices while offline, **When** both devices come online, **Then** one version is preserved as current and the other as a conflict copy
2. **Given** a conflict has been resolved, **When** I check my data, **Then** I see a notification about the conflict and can review both versions
3. **Given** I am reviewing a conflict, **When** I make a choice, **Then** I can keep the server version, local version, or merge manually
4. **Given** a conflict copy exists, **When** I resolve it, **Then** the duplicate is removed

---

### User Story 7 - Sync Activity History (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see sync activity history so I can understand what has been synced and troubleshoot issues.

**Why this priority**: Transparency into sync operations builds trust and aids debugging when issues occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing sync operations and verifying they appear in the history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to sync settings, **When** I view sync history, **Then** I see a chronological log of recent sync operations
2. **Given** a sync operation completed, **When** I view the history, **Then** I see the operation type, timestamp, and items affected
3. **Given** a sync error occurred, **When** I view the history, **Then** I see the error details and affected items

---

### User Story 8 - Manual Sync Trigger (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to force sync manually if needed so I can ensure my data is up-to-date on demand.

**Why this priority**: While automatic sync handles most cases, users need the ability to manually trigger sync when they want immediate synchronization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering manual sync and verifying pending changes are synchronized.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have pending changes, **When** I trigger manual sync, **Then** all pending changes are synchronized immediately
2. **Given** sync is already in progress, **When** I trigger manual sync, **Then** I see feedback that sync is already running

---

### User Story 9 - Local-Only Items (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to exclude certain items from sync (local-only notes) so I can keep sensitive content on just one device.

**Why this priority**: Some content may be too sensitive for cloud storage or only relevant to one device.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by marking an item as local-only and verifying it doesn't appear on other devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I mark a note as local-only, **When** I sync, **Then** the note is not uploaded to the server
2. **Given** I have a local-only note, **When** I check other devices, **Then** the note does not appear
3. **Given** I have a local-only note, **When** I remove the local-only flag, **Then** the note syncs to other devices

---

### User Story 10 - Background Sync (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want sync to work in the background without blocking my work so I can continue using the app while sync happens.

**Why this priority**: Sync operations should be invisible to the user's workflow. UI freezing during sync creates a poor experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a large sync operation and verifying the UI remains responsive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sync is in progress, **When** I continue working, **Then** the UI remains responsive
2. **Given** I am editing content, **When** background sync is running, **Then** my edits are not interrupted
3. **Given** a large initial sync is occurring, **When** I use the app, **Then** I can work normally while sync progresses

---

### User Story 11 - Selective Sync (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want selective sync on mobile (choose what to sync) so I can manage storage on devices with limited space.

**Why this priority**: Mobile devices often have storage constraints. Selective sync allows users to prioritize what data they need on mobile.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring selective sync and verifying only selected content appears on the device.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I configure selective sync, **Then** I can choose which categories to sync (notes, tasks, journal, etc.)
2. **Given** I have excluded a category from sync, **When** I check my device, **Then** items in that category are not present

---

### User Story 12 - Data Usage Visibility (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to see how much data is being used for sync so I can manage storage and bandwidth.

**Why this priority**: Users on limited data plans or storage need visibility into sync resource consumption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing data usage statistics in sync settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I navigate to sync settings, **When** I view data usage, **Then** I see total synced data size and breakdown by category

---

### User Story 13 - Sync Pause for Metered Connections (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want a sync pause option for metered connections so I don't consume mobile data unexpectedly.

**Why this priority**: Users on metered connections need control over when sync uses their data allowance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling pause on metered and verifying sync stops on metered connections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I enable "pause sync on metered connections", **When** I am on mobile data, **Then** sync pauses until I return to Wi-Fi or manually override

---

### User Story 14 - Device Removal (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to remove a device from my account so I can revoke access if a device is lost or sold.

**Why this priority**: Security requires the ability to revoke device access when devices change ownership or are compromised.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by removing a device and verifying it loses sync access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple linked devices, **When** I remove a device from my account, **Then** that device can no longer sync
2. **Given** I am removing a device, **When** I confirm removal, **Then** I see a confirmation that the device has been unlinked

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the recovery phrase is lost and no devices are accessible? (Account cannot be recovered - this must be clearly communicated during setup)
- How does the system handle sync during app updates or when encryption version changes? (Graceful migration with backwards compatibility)
- What happens if the server is unreachable for an extended period? (Local-only mode with unlimited queue growth until sync resumes)
- How does conflict resolution work for deleted items? (Deletion wins unless there's a newer edit)
- What happens when storage quota is exceeded? (Clear notification with guidance to free space or upgrade)
- How does the system handle corrupted encrypted data? (Skip item, log error, notify user, preserve local version if available)
- What happens when linking a device to an account that already has conflicting data? (Treat as merge with conflict resolution)
