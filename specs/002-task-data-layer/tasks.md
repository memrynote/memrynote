# Tasks: Task Management Data Layer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-task-data-layer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Context**: Backend layer is **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (~3000 LOC). Focus is on **verifying integration** and **completing minor gaps**.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Verification Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish verification baseline and understand current state

- [X] T001 Verify project builds without errors using `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build:mac`
  - Fixed task-specific type errors (task-utils.ts, tasks.tsx, kanban-board.tsx, etc.)
  - Pre-existing errors in other features (tabs, journal, notes) documented but out of scope
- [X] T002 Verify existing database schema matches spec in src/shared/db/schema/tasks.ts
  - All core fields present; isRepeating/subtaskIds computed (denormalized design)
- [X] T003 [P] Verify IPC handlers are registered in src/main/ipc/index.ts
  - registerTasksHandlers() called in registerAllHandlers()
- [X] T004 [P] Verify preload exposes tasks API in src/preload/index.ts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-16)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US1-5) can proceed in priority order
  - P2 stories (US6-10) can start after P1 verification
  - P3 stories (US11-14) can start after P2 verification
- **Bulk Operations (Phase 17)**: Depends on US4, US9 completion
- **Polish (Phase 18)**: Depends on all story verification complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Relates to US1 (statuses)
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Relates to US1 (persistence)
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Depends on T006 (RepeatConfig fix) - Core functionality
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent feature
- **User Story 8 (P2)**: May need notes system integration
- **User Story 9 (P2)**: Relates to US4 (completion)
- **User Story 10 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Client-side only
- **User Story 11 (P3)**: Can start after US7 (subtasks for duplication)
- **User Story 12 (P3)**: Can start after US2 (task fields)
- **User Story 13 (P3)**: Can start after US2 (task creation)
- **User Story 14 (P3)**: Can start after US3 (projects/statuses)

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T003 and T004 can run in parallel
- Phase 2: T008 and T009 can run in parallel
- Within each User Story: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- P1 User Stories can be verified by different developers in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After T005, T006, T007 complete sequentially (they have dependencies):
Task: "Verify TasksProvider properly subscribes to IPC events" [T008]
Task: "Verify type conversions (priority int↔string, dates)" [T009]
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Verification Focus)

Since backend is already implemented:
1. Complete Phase 1: Setup verification
2. Complete Phase 2: Fix integration gaps (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Persistence) - Core functionality
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run smoke tests
5. Continue with remaining P1 stories

### Incremental Verification

1. Fix integration gaps → Gaps resolved
2. Verify US1 (Persistence) → Core works
3. Verify US2-5 (Remaining P1) → All P1 features work
4. Verify US6-10 (P2) → Advanced features work
5. Verify US11-14 (P3) → All features work
6. Performance + Polish → Production ready

### Key Focus Areas

Given the plan.md analysis, prioritize:
1. **T005**: Status loading gap (blocks US3)
2. **T006**: RepeatConfig conversion (blocks US6)
3. **T007**: Data flow documentation (understanding)
4. **T068-T071**: Bulk operations verification (may not be using backend)

---

## Notes

- Backend is ~3000 LOC already implemented
- UI is ~1653 LOC in tasks.tsx alone + 144 component files
- Focus is verification, not implementation
- Client-side filtering may be intentional for performance (under 10k tasks)
- Saved filters use localStorage (not database) - document as intentional or future enhancement
- Undo is client-side only - acceptable for now per spec
