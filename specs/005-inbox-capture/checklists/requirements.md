# Specification Quality Checklist: Inbox System for Quick Capture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The user provided comprehensive requirements including data model and acceptance criteria
- P3 features (AI clustering, browser extension, mobile share sheet) were intentionally excluded from scope per user's prioritization
- Voice transcription service choice documented as assumption (OpenAI Whisper initially)
- All 11 user stories cover the complete user journey from capture to filing
- 40 functional requirements cover all specified functionality
- 10 success criteria provide measurable outcomes
